## Technology Utilized
This application was built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Node.js, MySQL, NPM, Handlebars, Github and Heroku . We chose to utilize the CSS framework [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/). For the REST Api we used [TheDogApi](https://docs.thedogapi.com/). Our app is hosted on [Github](https://github.com/leediamo/iwolfu) and [Heroku](https://iwolfu.herokuapp.com/). We sourced the map from the API [Open Street](https://www.openstreetmap.org/#map=6/38.891/-97.141). We used [Leaflet Interactive Map Guide](https://leafletjs.com/) for the markers on the map.
